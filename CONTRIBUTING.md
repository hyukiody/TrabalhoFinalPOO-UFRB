## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a suggestion for improvement:

1. Check if the issue already exists in the [Issues](https://github.com/hyukiody/TrabalhoFinalPOO-UFRB/issues) section
2. If not, create a new issue with a clear title and description
3. Include relevant details such as:
   - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
   - Expected vs. actual behavior
   - Python version and environment details

### Submitting Changes

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**:
   - Follow the existing code style and conventions
   - Write clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Add comments where necessary to explain complex logic
   - Ensure your code follows Python best practices (PEP 8)

3. **Test your changes**:
   - Test the application thoroughly
   - Ensure no existing functionality is broken

4. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add: brief description of your changes"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Open a Pull Request**:
   - Provide a clear description of the changes
   - Reference any related issues
   - Wait for review and be responsive to feedback

## Code Style Guidelines

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guide for Python code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to classes and functions
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility
- Use proper encapsulation (private attributes with `__` prefix)

## Object-Oriented Programming Principles

When contributing, please ensure your code adheres to OOP principles:

- **Encapsulation**: Use proper access modifiers and properties
- **Inheritance**: Create clear class hierarchies where appropriate
- **Polymorphism**: Implement method overriding when needed
- **Abstraction**: Hide complex implementation details
